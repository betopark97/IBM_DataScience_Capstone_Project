Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9b9e79e6-8497-49ce-b2e1-e914bf87726c","metadata":{},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/landing_1.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0fc39343-e511-4f02-aaaa-930eb60428d7","metadata":{},"source":["Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d8f06dd0-f33f-4d53-9a20-580a42011408","metadata":{},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/crash.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ef614108-fd8d-4344-948a-39d131d671df","metadata":{},"source":["Most unsuccessful landings are planed.
